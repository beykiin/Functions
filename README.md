<h1><i>FUNCTIONS</i></h1>
<p>This project generally focuses on functions, and I solved some examples. Questions:</p>
<p>1- Write a factorial calculation function that accepts input from outside.</p>
<p>2- Write a function that can perform arithmetic operations. The numbers and operations will be taken from the user, and these values will be sent as parameters.</p>
<p>3- Write a function that reverses a given text.</p>
<p>4- A function that reverses half of the text entered from the keyboard and capitalizes all letters in the other half.</p>
<p>5- If the length of the sentence taken from the keyboard is even, it should be written in reverse; if odd, it should capitalize even characters based on their position.</p>
<p>6- Write a function that, if the number entered from the keyboard is even, prints 'a' characters equal to its square; if odd, prints 'v' characters equal to one more than half of the number.</p>
<p>7- Take input from the user for name, surname, and number, then write them one below the other.</p>
<p>8- Rock, paper, scissors game.</p>
<p>9- Write a function that takes the square of the number if it is even, and the cube if it is odd, entered from the keyboard.</p>
<p>10- Write a function that converts Turkish characters to their English equivalents in a text entered from the keyboard.</p>
